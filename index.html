    <h1>HTML, or what the internet looks like naked.</h1>
    <p>NSFW</p>

    <p>
      What is HTML? I'm pretty sure we don't need it anymore and honestly, it's
      clunky.
      <em>here comes the break => </em><br />
      It sure is, friend. Feels real weird coming back to this language that
      I've taken approx 1000 free courses on, but still don't really know how to
      use bc it's honestly really boring.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Let's make an effort to learn about HTML, because old dogs deserve love
      too.
    </h2>
    <h2>Where to start? <strong>AT THE BEGINNING!</strong></h2>

    <p>
      There was a time where you had to talk on the phone with people because
      there was no way to send textual messages except through the USPS.
      <strong>Then!</strong>
      Our charasmatic former Vice President Al Gore found some tubes, connected
      them and the interet showed up. What a world.

        >Now is the part where we start using technical words that aren't super
        helpful, but if you remember them and use them correctly, you just might
        get a job.</em
      >
    </span>
    <p>HTML stands for 
        <ul>
            <li>HYPER</li>
            <li>TEXT</li>
            <li>MARKUP</li>
            <li>LANGUAGE</li>
        </ul>
        <em>stay with me.</em>
    </p>
    <h3>Thanks but what the fuck does that even mean, nerd?</h3>
    <p>Um, there's no need to be rude. Wow. <br />
        <p>STARTING FROM THE TOP <br />
            <em>Sidebar: I tend to start in the middle and I had this boss that always said this to me. He also said that my team didn't respect me because I was a woman. You take the good with the bad, i guess. </em><br />
            <br />
            <strong>ARE WE BORING YOU? </strong> <em> So sorry, continue. </em><br />
            <br />
        Big picture: HTML is the <em>most basic</em> building block of the Web. It's the pumpkin spice latte of programming languages - a real basic bitch. 
        It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Imagine a description of a series a squares all over the page with different things in them. Google Chrome takes that description and renders it in the browser for you to see with your eyes. 
        When you look at that description, you don't see the squares - you have to imagine them. It just looks like text with <'s' and /'s'. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>CAN WE GET BACK TO WHAT THE LETTERS MEAN. </h4>
        So starting with 'hypertext' (which apparently is one word but we're pretending it's two seperate words for our acrostic). Hypertext are the links that connect webpages together OR even connects a place on the webpage to another part of the page.They are the pieces of string connecting all the elements of your insane conspiracy theory about Pepe Silvia.</p>
        <p>Markup language is a system that annotates the text in a way that looks <em>different</em> than the content. It's there to format the text. It's like the crew of the movie - they're getting their actors and elements ready, but in the final product, the crew is hidden and you just see the elements. What a metaphor.</p>
    
    
        <h3>This was fun, but this is really not interesting at all.</h3>
        <strong>TRUST, WE'RE GETTING THERE. </strong> 
        <p>The next part is about architecture but after that! Treat!</p>
