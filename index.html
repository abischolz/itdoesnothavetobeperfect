    <h1>HTML, or what the internet looks like naked.</h1>
    <p>NSFW</p>

    <p>
      What is HTML? I'm pretty sure we don't need it anymore and honestly, it's
      clunky.
      <em>here comes the break => </em><br />
      It sure is, friend. Feels real weird coming back to this language that
      I've taken approx 1000 free courses on, but still don't really know how to
      use bc it's honestly really boring.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Let's make an effort to learn about HTML, because old dogs deserve love
      too.
    </h2>
    <h2>Where to start? <strong>AT THE BEGINNING!</strong></h2>

    <p>
      There was a time where you had to talk on the phone with people because
      there was no way to send textual messages except through the USPS.
      <strong>Then!</strong>
      Our charasmatic former Vice President Al Gore found some tubes, connected
      them and the interet showed up. What a world.

        >Now is the part where we start using technical words that aren't super
        helpful, but if you remember them and use them correctly, you just might
        get a job.</em
      >
    </span>
    <p>HTML stands for 
        <ul>
            <li>HYPER</li>
            <li>TEXT</li>
            <li>MARKUP</li>
            <li>LANGUAGE</li>
        </ul>
        <em>stay with me.</em>
    </p>
    <h3>Thanks but what the fuck does that even mean, nerd?</h3>
    <p>Um, there's no need to be rude. Wow. <br />
        <p>STARTING FROM THE TOP <br />
            <em>Sidebar: I tend to start in the middle and I had this boss that always said this to me. 
              He also said that my team didn't respect me because I was a woman. You take the good with the bad, i guess. </em><br />
            <br />
            <strong>ARE WE BORING YOU? </strong> <em> So sorry, continue. </em><br />
            <br />
        Big picture: HTML is the <em>most basic</em> building block of the Web. It's the pumpkin spice latte of programming 
        languages - a real basic bitch. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Imagine a description of a series 
        a squares all over the page with different things in them. Google Chrome takes that description and renders it in the 
        browser for you to see with your eyes. When you look at that description, you don't see the squares - you have to imagine 
        them. It just looks like text with <'s' and /'s'. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>CAN WE GET BACK TO WHAT THE LETTERS MEAN. </h4>
        So starting with 'hypertext' (which apparently is one word but we're pretending it's two seperate words for our acrostic). 
        Hypertext are the links that connect webpages together OR even connects a place on the webpage to another part of the page.
        They are the pieces of string connecting all the elements of your insane conspiracy theory about Pepe Silvia.</p>
        <p>Markup language is a system that annotates the text in a way that looks <em>different</em> than the content. It's there 
          to format the text, like instructions for your computer. It's like the crew of the movie - they're getting their actors 
          and elements ready, but in the final product, the crew is hidden and you just see the elements. What a metaphor.</p>
    
    
        <h3>This was fun, but this is really not interesting at all.</h3>
        <strong>TRUST, WE'RE GETTING THERE. </strong> 
        <p>The next part is about architecture but after that! Treat!</p>

        <P>Some Vocab for the HTML! 
            <ul>
                <li>Elements!</li>
                <li>Declarations!</li>
                <li>Attributes!</li>
                <li>Tags! and also CLosing Tags!</li>
                <li>Content!</li>
                <li>Types!</li>
            </ul>
        </P>
        <h5>Ingredients for the <em>perfect</em> HTML page</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>One Document Type Declaration <em>(HTML5 if you can find it)</em></li>
            <li>Two dashes of the &lt;html&gt; tag</li>
            <li>One &lt;head&gt; element, to really highlight all that metadata</li>
            <li>One &lt;body&gt; element, to keep your content in-line (or block :) )</li>
            <li>Close it all out with a &lt;footer&gt; element</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some content on top for flavor **chef's kiss**</li>
        </ul>
        <p> And voila, you have yourself a good old-fashioned web page.</p>

    <p>Well, you have what could be seen as the start of a webpage. You've got some empty <em>elements</em>, which 
      could turn into something. But what to fill them with?</p> 

      <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/vFtWp05vBYnMQ" alt = "A cat playing the piano while wearing a Hawaiian shirt" />
    <p>Text! Images! Videos! Links to other places! The world is your oyster. All of these different types of boxes are called 
      <em>elements</em>. So fun. Elements are the legos of the web -> put them together, follow the directions (or don't) and 
      now you've got some legos that are connected together!
    </p>
    <h3>Let's start with text</h3>

    <p>Text is pretty easy. In short, text is the stuff between the opening and closing tags. What those tags are determines how
      they'll appear on the website. <br /> 
      There are preset text sizes, which is exciting. These are the ...head class? I'm not sure what they're called, but 
      they look like this: 
      <div>
        <h1>
          &lt;h1&gt;
          It does not have to be perfect</h1>
        <h2>&lt;h2&gt; It does not have to be perfect</h2>
        
        <h3>&lt;h3&gt; It does not have to be perfect</h3>
        
        <h4> &lt;h4&gt; It does not have to be perfect</h4>
        
        <h5>&lt;h5&gt;It does not have to be perfect</h5>
        <h6>&lt;h6&gt;It does not have to be perfect</h6>
      </div>

      They can add structure to your document, creating a nice outline feel. That's why all the pages on the internet look like 
      an outline for a bad paper on the American Revolution. <strong>JK</strong>

      For normal text (just the regular stuff that makes up the paper), there's teh &lt;p&gt; type. It stands for paragraph, and 
      that's pretty much its deal - throw some words in there for the meat of your content (unless you're more of an image person - 
      more on that later).
      
      But! There you are, writing along and you really want to emphasize something - maybe it's a <em>nuanced point</em> or maybe it's just 
      <em>a thought you had that was a non-sequitor</em>, but you want it to stand out. But it's not super important- you don't 
      need it to be like a header. Maybe italics would work? 

      <em><h2>BOOM!</h2></em>

      Enter the emphasis tag: &lt;em&gt; When text is between these two tags, it becomes italicized. It can be a &lt;p&gt; or an &lt;h6&gt; element. 
      It's like a wrapper that you put on a piece of candy -

    <p>
      Sometimes you have to be <strong>strong</strong>, but other times you just
      need some <em>emphasis</em>
